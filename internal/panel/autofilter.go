// The autofilter is the second answer a panel can give to the quick search: it
// hides every row that does not match instead of moving the cursor to the first
// match, so what is left on screen is the result (f4 #1131). Matching itself is
// unchanged -- the same fuzzy matcher the cursor-moving search uses, so a query
// behaves identically in both modes and only the presentation differs.
//
// The rows are deliberately not re-ranked by match quality the way the hotkey
// table ranks its own: a file panel would lose folders-first and its sort order,
// which is the frame of reference the user navigates by.
//
// fp.Entries stays the visible list, which is what nearly everything asks it
// for -- the row count, the cell provider, the cursor, the marked names, the
// totals in the status row. The rows the filter holds back live in
// unfilteredEntries, so a chunked directory load or the two-second mtime
// refresh keeps filling the complete list while the user is still typing.
// unfilteredEntries is meaningful only while autoFilterOn is set; otherwise
// fp.Entries is the complete list.

// AllEntries returns every row the panel holds, the ones the autofilter is
// hiding included. Use it wherever the question is about the directory rather
// than about what the user can see.
